    <title>Leadership Creed #1</title>
    <h1>I shall lead by example</h1>
</head>
<body>
    <p class="numbaOne">This leadership creed I practiced, because I have realized how truly important it is to show example on how to set up goals and accomplish them. Everyone's influence and input is quite important, the problem is that not everyone will say what they have to say, which is why it is important to lead by example, to set an example for others. Being a leader, is more than just a position, I know that would be related to the fifth leadership creed but, it has a lot to do with the first creed. I had a talk with my brother about going to college or a university, he told me he didn't get the point of it since he didn't believe that much in the idea that college and/or university would be helpful, and by that time I was applied to Pierce College classes even if enrolling was quite stressful... I told him that the reason I enrolled to these courses was so I could gain more knowledge from colleges, plus new opportunities that are presented to me for a pursuit of a career, like new opportunities to develop my knowledge and future career or applying these skills that can be helpful in the future, and opens doors to many opportunities! I think of them as an investment for the future that sacrifices some of my free time and that is okay because I am using this free time to be productive. At the end of the day, sacrifice, dedication, and effort pays off.</p>
