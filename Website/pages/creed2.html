    <p class="numbaTwo">If you think about it, even with things that take time to master... it's really not hard just a lot of work and effort to put in. I have been balancing work from school and college as well as my free time and exercise time, I am constantly busy but I know things are not hard just a lot of work. I was reading a book once and it was called, "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki and the book made me learn more about myself, one of the quotes from it was something along the lines of, "your mind is your greatest asset" as well as education being really crucial but schools lack to teach it. This book made me think of things another way and it reminded me a lot about the leadership creeds. Now I am still working hard, but I remind myself from time to time that things aren't difficult but rather take time and effort to master or to do, all I have to do is practice everyday. One more thing, I find it so ridiculous of how I live far away from things that are important to me, like the Cube or my school... however, I will still do my utmost best to arrive on time, with readiness beforehand.</p>
