    <h1>I will strive to strengthen my mind, body, and soul</h1>

    <p class="numbaThree">I recently started getting back into working out again since I had a little more time (before SEALS of course) I do some workouts and push past my limits to do better than next time, and I go the extra mile to make sure I get stronger and stronger everyday, I like overcoming challenges. I have developed new healthy habits like taking military-style, cold showers and have more organization with my time than ever before and I want to learn new things everyday. What I need to work on now, is going out more with my friends and family, I need some time to chill with my friends, my girlfriend, and family, I am really happy that we're organizing stuff for Halloween. I did exercise during quarantine but I have been having random hiatuses, now I want to continue, but only when I can so I have enough practice and energy, I have been strengthening my body. I have strengthened my mind because I became more open to learning, I strongly dislike reading but I had to finish "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" because I knew it would teach me important things, I want to learn how to handle finance and investments, and I got back into SEALS because I want to learn more about coding, I wish to apply my knowledge and skills on my future career, to create new things using technology. Finally, to strengthen my soul, this year would be the year where I ever had the most focus in my life, ever and I'm quite proud of myself because I have changed a lot to be better over the years.<p>
